# Parking Lot Simulator

### parking_lot_single_day

Analyses the data provided in a text file and identifies the busiest time interval on the parking lot, 
i.e. when the number of cars on the parking lot was at maximum.

#### Input

Data representing only one day of work is passed in a text file as a list in format:

        12:01 13:17
        03:04 11:56
        ...
    
Every row represents a single carâ€™s parking start and end times.

#### Output

Maximum number of cars and time interval.

#### How to run

Navigate to parking_lot_single_day and run the following command:

```shell
g++ -std=c++11 parking_lot.cpp -o parking_lot
./parking_lot
```

### parking_lot_JSON
    
Analyses JSON data and identifies the busiest time on the parking lot, i.e. when the number of cars on the parking lot was at maximum.

#### Input

Data representing arbitrary number of work days is passed in the following format:

			[{
				"Id": 0,
				"ArrivalTime": "2016-05-01T06:36:00",
				"LeaveTime": "2016-05-01T13:28:00"
			}, 
			{
				"Id": 1,
				"ArrivalTime": "2016-05-01T14:17:00",
				"LeaveTime": "2016-05-02T01:35:00"
			}, 
			{
				"Id": 2,
				"ArrivalTime": "2016-05-04T00:15:00",
				"LeaveTime": "2016-05-04T06:55:00"
			}]

#### Output

Time interval with maximum number of cars for each date.

	Date: 2016-05-01
	Maximum numbers of cars 2 at 14:17-23:59.

	Date: 2016-05-04
	Maximum numbers of cars 3 at 00:15-23:59.

	Date: 2018-05-03
	Maximum numbers of cars 3 at 00:00-06:55.

	Date: 2018-05-04
	Maximum numbers of cars 2 at 00:00-13:28.

	Date: 2018-06-02
	Maximum numbers of car: 1 
	No overlapping intevals.

#### How to run

Navigate to parking_lot_JSON and run the following command:

```shell
g++ -std=c++11 parking_lot_json.cpp -o parking_lot_json
./parking_lot_json
```

### Visualization

Its possible to plot the maximum number of cars for each date. To generate the plot run:

```shell
chmod +x plot.sh
./plot.sh
```
